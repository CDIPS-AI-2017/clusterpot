      " 'One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.'\n",
      " 'He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"'\n",
      " \"Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\"\n",

      " 'He raised his voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\"Oooooooh!\"'\n",
      " 'Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\"Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin.'\n",
      " 'A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty, But don\\'t judge on what you see, I\\'ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.'\n",

      " 'They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again.\"The Bloody Baron\\'s the only one who can control him, he won\\'t even listen to us prefects.'\n",
      " 'Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too.'\n",
      " 'The Bloody Baron\\'s becoming almost unbearable -- he\\'s the Slytherin ghost.\"Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.'\n",
      " 'Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said.'\n",

      " 'Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\"became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\\'s twin brothers catcalling.\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin.'\n",
      " 'My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight.'\n",
      " \"There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.\"\n",
      " 'Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching.'\n",
      " 'Bit of a nasty shock for him.\"The others laughed.\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.\"Well, my gran brought me up and she\\'s a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages.'\n",
      " 'Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\"Granger, Hermione!\"Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat.'\n",
      " 'My brothers told me about you -- you\\'re Nearly Headless Nick!\"\"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\"Nearly Headless?'\n",
      " 'What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --\"\"My dear Friar, haven\\'t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?'\n",

      " 'Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"'\n",
      " 'He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.\"Welcome,\" he said.'\n",
      " 'Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go.'\n",
      " 'How can you be nearly headless?\"Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\\'t going at all the way he wanted.\"Like this,\" he said irritably.'\n",
      " 'I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\"\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore.'\n",
      " 'She had a very stern face and Harry\\'s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.\"Thank you, Hagrid.'\n",
      " 'You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.'\n",
      " 'A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"'\n",
      " \"You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no?\"\n",
      " 'The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.'\n",
      " 'He\\'s chewing my sheets.\"Harry was going to ask Ron if he\\'d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.'\n",
      " 'Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\\'s look -- a feeling that he didn\\'t like Harry at all.\"Who\\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?'\n",

      " 'I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\"It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\\'t simply open on to the heavens.'\n",
      " \"He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny.\"\n",
      " 'The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts.'\n",
      " \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that.\"\n",
      " \"Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.\"\n",
      " 'You\\'re in safe hands (though I have none) For I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\"The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song.'\n",
      " 'They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.'\n",
      " 'It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.'\n",
      " 'Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\\'d seen earlier.'\n",

      " 'If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.'\n",
      " 'He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.'\n",
      " 'Off you trot!\"The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.'\n",

      "Yes, trying on the hat was a lotbetter than having to do a spell, but he did wish theycould have tried it on without everyone watching.\n",

      "GRYFFINDOR!”Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsedinto the chair next to him.“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasleypompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,”\n",
      "wasmade a Slytherin.\n",
      "Professor McGonagall rolled up herscroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\n",
      "Harry looked down at his empty gold plate.\n",
      "He hadonly just realized how hungry he was.\n",
      "The pumpkinpasties seemed ages ago.\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.\n",
      "He wasbeaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as ifnothing could have pleased him more than to seethem all there.“Welcome!” he said.\n",
      "“\n",
      "Welcome to a new year atHogwarts!\n",
      "Before we begin our banquet, I would liketo say a few words.\n",
      "And here they are: Nitwit!Blubber!\n",
      "Oddment!\n",
      "Tweak!“Thank you!”He sat back down.\n",
      "Everybody clapped and cheered.\n",
      "Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.“Mad?”\n",
      "said Percy airily. “\n",
      "He’s a genius! Best wizardin the world!\n",
      "But he is a bit mad, yes.\n",
      "Potatoes,Harry?”Harry’s mouth fell open.\n",
      "The dishes in front of himwere now piled with food.\n",
      "He had never seen so manythings he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roastchicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages,bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes,fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy,ketchup, and, for some strange reason, pepperminthumbugs.\n",
      "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, buthe’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.\n",
      "Dudley had always taken anything that Harry reallywanted, even if it made him sick.\n",
      "Harry piled his platewith a bit of everything except the peppermints andbegan to eat.\n",
      "It was all delicious.“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly,watching Harry cut up his steak.“Can’t you — ?”“\n",
      "I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” saidthe ghost.\n",
      "“I don’t need to, of course, but one doesmiss it.\n",
      "I don’t think I’ve introduced myself?\n",
      "SirNicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service.\n",
      "Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”“I know who you are!”\n",
      "said Ron suddenly.\n",
      "“Mybrothers told me about you — you’re Nearly HeadlessNick!”“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy— ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired SeamusFinnigan interrupted.“Nearly Headless?\n",
      "How can you be nearly headless?”Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their littlechat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.“Like this,” he said irritably.\n",
      "He seized his left ear andpulled.\n",
      "His whole head swung off his neck and fellonto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.\n",
      "Someonehad obviously tried to behead him, but not done itproperly.\n",
      "Looking pleased at the stunned looks ontheir faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his headback onto his neck, coughed, and said, “\n",
      "So — newGryffindors!\n",
      "I hope you’re going to help us win theHouse Championship this year?\n",
      "Gryffindors havenever gone so long without winning.\n",
      "Slytherins havegot the cup six years in a row!\n",
      "The Bloody Baron’sbecoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytheringhost.”Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw ahorrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, agaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.\n",
      "Hewas right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased tosee, didn’t look too pleased with the seatingarrangements.“How did he get covered in blood?\n",
      "” asked Seamuswith great interest.“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nickdelicately.\n",
      "When everyone had eaten as much as they could, theremains of the food faded from the plates, leavingthem sparkling clean as before.\n",
      "A moment later thedesserts appeared.\n",
      "Blocks of ice cream in every flavoryou could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolateeclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-0, rice pudding ...\n",
      "As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talkturned to their families.“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus.\n",
      "“Me dad’s a Muggle.\n",
      "Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after theywere married.\n",
      "Bit of a nasty shock for him.”The others laughed.“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,”said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Mugglefor ages.\n",
      "My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch meoff my guard and force some magic out of me — hepushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearlydrowned — but nothing happened until I was eight.\n",
      "Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he washanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankleswhen my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringueand he accidentally let go.\n",
      "But I bounced — all theway down the garden and into the road.\n",
      "They were allreally pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy.\n",
      "And you should have seen their faces when I got inhere — they thought I might not be magic enough tocome, you see.\n",
      "Great Uncle Algie was so pleased hebought me my toad.”On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermionewere talking about lessons (“I do hope they start rightaway, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularlyinterested in Transfiguration, you know, turningsomething into something else, of course, it’ssupposed to be very difficult — “\n",
      "You’ll be startingsmall, just matches into needles and that sort ofthing — ”).Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy,looked up at the High Table again.\n",
      "Hagrid wasdrinking deeply from his goblet.\n",
      "Professor McGonagallwas talking to Professor Dumbledore.\n",
      "ProfessorQuirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to ateacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, andsallow skin.\n",
      "It happened very suddenly.\n",
      "The hook-nosed teacherlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’seyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar onHarry’s forehead.“Ouch!\n",
      "” Harry clapped a hand to his head.“What is it?\n",
      "” asked Percy.“N-nothing.”The pain had gone as quickly as it had come.\n",
      "Harderto shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from theteacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry atall.“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\n",
      "” heasked Percy.“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you?\n",
      "No wonderhe’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape.\n",
      "Heteaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyoneknows he’s after Quirrell’s job.\n",
      "Knows an awful lotabout the Dark Arts, Snape.”Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’tlook at him again.\n",
      "At last, the desserts too disappeared, and ProfessorDumbledore got to his feet again.\n",
      "The hall fell silent.“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are allfed and watered.\n",
      "I have a few start-of-term notices togive you.“First years should note that the forest on thegrounds is forbidden to all pupils.\n",
      "And a few of ourolder students would do well to remember that aswell.”Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the directionof the Weasley twins.“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, toremind you all that no magic should be used betweenclasses in the corridors.“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week ofthe term.\n",
      "Anyone interested in playing for their Houseteams should contact Madam Hooch.“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of boundsto everyone who does not wish to die a very painfuldeath.”Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore.\n",
      "“It’sodd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’renot allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full ofdangerous beasts, everyone knows that.\n",
      "I do think hemight have told us prefects, at least.”“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the schoolsong!” cried Dumbledore.\n",
      "Harry noticed that the otherteachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.\n",
      "Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he wastrying to get a fly off the end, and a long goldenribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tablesand twisted itself, snakelike, into words.“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore,“and off we go!”And the school bellowed:“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,Teach us something please,Whether we be old and baldOr young with scabby knees,Our heads could do with fillingWith some interesting stuff,For now they’re bare and full of air,Dead flies and bits of fluff,So teach us things worth knowing,Bring back what we’ve forgot,Just do your best, we’ll do the rest,And learn until our brains all rot.”Everybody finished the song at different times.\n",
      "At last,only the Weasley twins were left singing along to avery slow funeral march.\n",
      "Dumbledore conducted theirlast few lines with his wand and when they hadfinished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes.\n",
      "“A magicbeyond all we do here!\n",
      "And now, bedtime.\n",
      "Off youtrot!”The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through thechattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up themarble staircase.\n",
      "Harry’s legs were like lead again,but only because he was so tired and full of food.\n",
      "Hewas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people inthe portraits along the corridors whispered andpointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led themthrough doorways hidden behind sliding panels andhanging tapestries.\n",
      "They climbed more staircases,yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was justwondering how much farther they had to go whenthey came to a sudden halt.\n",
      "A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midairahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward themthey started throwing themselves at him.“Peeves,”\n",
      "Percy whispered to the first years.\n",
      "“Apoltergeist.\n",
      "” He raised his voice, “\n",
      "Peeves — showyourself.”A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of aballoon, answered.“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, darkeyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “\n",
      "IckleFirsties!\n",
      "What fun!”He swooped suddenly at them.\n",
      "They all ducked.“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, Imean it!” barked Percy.\n",
      "Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, droppingthe walking sticks on Neville’s head.\n",
      "They heard himzooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, asthey set off again. “\n",
      "The Bloody Baron’s the only onewho can control him, he won’t even listen to usprefects.\n",
      "Here we are.”At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of avery fat woman in a pink silk dress.“Password?” she said.“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swungforward to reveal a round hole in the wall.\n",
      "They allscrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up —and found themselves in the Gryffindor commonroom, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\n",
      "Percy directed the girls through one door to theirdormitory and the boys through another.\n",
      "At the top ofa spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of thetowers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains.\n",
      "Theirtrunks had already been brought up.\n",
      "Too tired to talkmuch, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry throughthe hangings. “Get off Scabbers!\n",
      "He’s chewing mysheets.”Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of thetreacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\n",
      "Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because hehad a very strange dream.\n",
      "He was wearing ProfessorQuirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, tellinghim he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because itwas his destiny.\n",
      "Harry told the turban he didn’t wantto be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he triedto pull it off but it tightened painfully — and therewas Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it —then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher,Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — therewas a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweatingand shaking.\n",
      "He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when hewoke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.\n"
